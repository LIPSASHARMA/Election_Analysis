# Election_Analysis
UoT Election Analysis Assignment

## Project Overview
With help from Tom, an election dataset needs to be analyzed in python and the following information has to be derived from the analysis:
  - Total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - Total number of votes each candidate received
  - Percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote

Once the analysis has been done and information has been retrieved, the same has to be updated in a file called election_analysis.txt


## Resources
- Dataset to be analyzed: election_results.csv
- Softwares used: Python 3.8.5, VSCode 1.71.0 


## Summary
- Total Number of votes polled: 369,711
- Candidates: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, Raymon Anthony Doane
- Results: 
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of total votes and got 85,213 votes
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of total votes and got 272,892 votes
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of total votes and got 11,606 votes

- Election Winner: Diana DeGette is the final winner of elections with 73.8% of total votes and got 272,892 votes

## Challenge Overview
The Pypoll challenge extends the original Election Analysis and expects that the instead of analyzing the data based on candidates, it should now be analyzed based on counties.

## Challenge Summary
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

Answer: 
The election commission can use this report to run a similar data set for past couple of years and form a conclusion on how the voter turnout is trending on year-on-year basis. If a candidate is representing a county year over year then the candidate's popularity can be measured over the years extending the script. There is also a possibility on how various candidates fared against each other over the years.
