# Election_Analysis
UoT Election Analysis Assignment

## Project Overview
With help from Tom, an election dataset needs to be analyzed in python and the following information has to be derived from the analysis:
  - Total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - Total number of votes each candidate received
  - Percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote

Once the analysis has been done and information has been retrieved, the same has to be updated in a file called election_analysis.txt


## Resources
- Dataset to be analyzed: election_results.csv
- Softwares used: Python 3.8.5, VSCode 1.71.0 


## Summary
- Total Number of votes polled: 369,711
- Candidates: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, Raymon Anthony Doane
- Results: 
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of total votes and got 85,213 votes
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of total votes and got 272,892 votes
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of total votes and got 11,606 votes

- Election Winner: Diana DeGette is the final winner of elections with 73.8% of total votes and got 272,892 votes

## Challenge Overview
The Pypoll challenge extends the original Election Analysis and expects that the instead of analyzing the data based on candidates, it should now be analyzed based on counties.
